#### What is this:

Chat bot on my friends' discord server. It is just a joke for traininig some skills.

#### What bot can do:

0. Moderating chat to protect it from filthy language.
0. A role auto-issuing and greeting.
0. Knowledge of some commands like `!help` and `!rules`.
0. Judging duels between server members. It will mute a loser in voice chat for 60 seconds.
0. Informing about some of Destiny's in-game events.
0. Making some dirty and unfair things by administrator's command. Members don't like it, but who cares :)

#### What else you should know:

Bot's name is **Quo 99-40**. Its name is a tribute to my love for Warhammer 40Ðš and Destiny 2. It is pretty cool, but not so useful as its more perfect colleagues-bots.
